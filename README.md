This is a project for my university diploma. Here I use Recurrent Neural Networks for time series prediction. Through experimental evidence, I have made a conclusion that LSTM-based models perform the best, especially on non-stationary data. The old ARIMA models are performing rather poorly and can only really be used for data with small amount of entries, where neural networks have little effect.
Datasets used include data from Sophist HSE - Higher School of Economics statistical data on Russian demographics, economy performance indicators and so on.
Another thing I have used was stock data, where there is more data to really test the models and get away from university-provided playground examples.
